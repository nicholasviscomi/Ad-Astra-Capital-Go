PREREQUISITE QUESTIONS

? After how many days of stagnation (defined as movement within Â±2%) should the trade be exited, if at all
? When there is a catalyst, where should the stop-loss be placed to guard against sudden price drop offs

***

GOAL: Given the details of a transaction from an insider, predict whether the stock is likely to be profitable

INPUTS:
- n shares bought
- price per share
- % change in ownership
- firm size would be great to have
- insider title (CEO, CFO, 10%, etc.)
- passivity of the trade (whether prior stock returns are down or or up)
- cluster buying (whether multiple insiders are buying around the same time)
    - only a positive indicator: its presence is good; its absence has no meaning
- insider's track record with buying
- days between filing and trading

IDEAS FOR OUTPUTS:

Simple:
    - will be winning (perhaps defined as +3%?)
    - will be losing
  * will simply light up a node as a prediction of likely profit or loss
