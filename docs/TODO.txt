[x] Make a trade object with the bought & sell price, start & end index in the file, and whether it's short or long.
    It should prolly just be a -1 multiplier for doing calculations 
        --> (calculate all profit the same and multiply by -1 for short)
[x] graph the winning and losing trades to ensure things are working correctly

[x] create pie charts of what type of trades the winners and losers are 
    --> then look out whether the market was bearish or bullish to see if there is a correlation????

Things to test:
    [x] analyze results if only going long/short
    [ ] Loop through different CE_MULTIPLIERs and ATR lengths
        --> To do this I need to make ATR variable length, which also
            means keeping track of the previous 30 points
    [ ] Look at the time of day when the losing trades are
        --> Lack of volatility is terrible for profit, so don't trade at 2am or something like that bro
    [ ] Loop through different combinations of ema lengths
        --> O(n^2) so don't do too many
    [ ] Loop through different stop loss thresholds

CE Strat Problems:
    [ ] When I open a trade with CE strat, if the next candle is in the wrong direction by about 40% of
        the previous candle it's usually a big loss
    $$$ It is only successful going either long or short. CANNOT do both
    ??? Almost double the amount of losing trades compared to winning ones
    [ ] Don't trade when theres no volume

[ ] Should I just append the csv file with a ton of indicators I calculate?
    ??? Could then sell this data on reddit for cheap or something
