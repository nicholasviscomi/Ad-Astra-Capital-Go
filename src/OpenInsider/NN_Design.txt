PREREQUISITE QUESTIONS

? After how many days of stagnation (defined as movement within ±2%) should the trade be exited, if at all
? When there is a catalyst, where should the stop-loss be placed to guard against sudden price drop offs

***

GOAL: Given the details of a transaction from an insider, predict whether the stock is likely to be profitable

#### SIMPLE NN ####
INPUTS:
[x] n shares bought
[x] price per share (should likely act as an alternative to firm size)
[x] % change in ownership
[ ] insider title (CEO, CFO, 10%, etc.)
    --> map each title to a number
[x] passivity of the trade (whether prior stock returns are down or or up)
[x] cluster buying (number of insiders buying around the same time)
    NOTE: should only be a positive indicator: its presence is good; its absence has no meaning
[x] days between filing and trading
[x] insider track record
    [x] average trade result @ 30, 60, 90 days
    [x] number of wins
    [x] average win
    [x] number of losses
    [x] average loss

OUTPUTS:

Profit Ranges: (best idea so far)
    - one node for stagnation (±1%) and then a node for each quartile of the profit distribution 
    - node for outliers in each direction

POTENTIAL SOURCES OF ERROR:
- cluster buying acting as a negative indicator
- defining cluster buying by the difference between trade date
    ? If filing date is way after, it might screw everything up
- defining cluster buying as trades from the same company within 30 days 
    ? too small, too big, who knows
