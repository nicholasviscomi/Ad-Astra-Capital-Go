Manually Checking the Profit Calculations for the Forms

Note: I might be able to fix this by training models with different profit
      calculations and just picking the highest accuracy model

100, QNBC: first peak makes it seem pretty bad but it isn't

4300 made me realize that a very valuable heuristic might be something about where to set your profit goal to
      --> perhaps this could be the output of the neural net. In this example, you could easily get a 20% win
          but if you stayed too long it would be a massive loss.
(same for 4400, 4500, 4600, 4900, 5000, 5200, 5400, 5600, 5700)

6600, NOVA: need to update the profit function, such that if the stock goes down 5% before reaching a peak it's 
            considered a 5% loss, regardless of how big the peak is

4300, BCOW: perhaps do some analysis on the base of the peak (find peak width in properties???). For example,
            if a peak has a steep, lasting decline after the peak, the profit needs to reflect that

4400, WTI: 32% profit to the top of the peak, but there is a steep decline thereafter. Not sure whether this should be
           penalized in the profit calculations or not. When trading, I will be using a stop loss, so when the profit
           reaches a certain threshold, any subsequent drop will cancel the trade. Thus, perhaps the profit of this trade
           should be the peak minus 5% because of the major dropoff (change profit calculations, not get_peaks)

- perhaps these calculations are just meant to show the potential a trade has. The point of this NN is to find when an 
  insider transaction is likely leading to a catalyst, so maybe the catalyst size is a valid metric. It certainly should
  NOT be the profit calculation, however.
      --> get_peaks as of now is good for quantifying catalyst size but not realistic profit

5600, TMP: days_before_catalyst could also be a very good metric. If it has been a month with no rise, maybe exit
