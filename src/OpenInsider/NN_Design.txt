PREREQUISITE QUESTIONS

? After how many days of stagnation (defined as movement within ±2%) should the trade be exited, if at all
? When there is a catalyst, where should the stop-loss be placed to guard against sudden price drop offs

***

GOAL: Given the details of a transaction from an insider, predict whether the stock is likely to be profitable

#### SIMPLE NN ####
INPUTS:
[x] n shares bought
[x] price per share (should likely act as an alternative to firm size)
[x] % change in ownership
[~] insider title (CEO, CFO, 10%, etc.)
[x] passivity of the trade (whether prior stock returns are down or or up)
[ ] cluster buying (whether multiple insiders are buying around the same time)
    [ ] only a positive indicator: its presence is good; its absence has no meaning
[x] days between filing and trading
[x] insider track record
    [x] average trade result @ 30, 60, 90 days
    [x] number of wins
    [x] average win
    [x] number of losses
    [x] average loss
[ ] purchasing/selling month signals
    [ ] net buying or selling in the company over the past 3 months

OUTPUTS:

Profit Ranges: (best idea so far)
    - one node for stagnation (±1%) and then a node for each quartile of the profit distribution 
    - node for outliers in each direction
