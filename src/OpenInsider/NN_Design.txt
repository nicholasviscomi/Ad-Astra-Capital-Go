Neural Network Design

INPUTS:
    - n shares bought
        - 5 nodes
            1) lower outlier
            2) Q1 - min 
            3) IQR
            4) Q3 - max
            5) upper outlier

    - price per share (should likely act as an alternative to firm size)
        - 5 nodes (same schema)

    - % change in ownership
        - 5 nodes (same schema)

    - insider title (CEO, CFO, 10%, etc.)
        --> map each title to a number
        - 4 nodes for other, 10%, director, officer

    - passivity of the trade (whether prior stock returns are down or or up)
        - returns(-30)
        - 5 nodes (same schema)

    - cluster buying (number of insiders buying around the same time)
        
    - days between filing and trading

    ????
    - insider track record
        - average trade result @ 30, 60, 90 days
        - number of wins
        - average win
        - number of losses
        - average loss
