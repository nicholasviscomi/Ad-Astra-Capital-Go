[ ] Make a trade object with the bought & sell price, start & end index in the file, and whether it's short or long.
    It should prolly just be a -1 multiplier for doing calculations 
        --> (calculate all profit the same and multiply by -1 for short)

[ ] graph the winning and losing trades to ensure things are working correctly
[ ] Add in stop loss and take profit thresholds
[ ] Once a certain profit threshold is hit, add a stop loss in the profit zone

[ ] try targetting only a certain amount of loss
    - there is almost always way more losing trades, so try and get out at a good time
      so the big trades can really win
        --> Do some analysis and find the point of no return for profit. At what % of loss is there 
            statistically no more reasonable hope of it turning to profit again?
    [ ] make it easy to change reward to risk ratio

[ ] loop through different combinations of EMAs to see the best length
