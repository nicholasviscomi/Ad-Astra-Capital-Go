OpenInsider Neural Network Design

PREREQUISITE QUESTIONS

? After how many days of stagnation (defined as movement within Â±2%) should the trade be exited, if at all
? When there is a catalyst, where should the stop-loss be placed to guard against sudden price drop offs

***

GOAL: Given the details of a transaction from an insider, predict whether the stock is likely to be profitable

#### SIMPLE NN ####
INPUTS:
- n shares bought
- price per share (should likely act as an alternative to firm size)
- % change in ownership
- firm size would be great to have
- insider title (CEO, CFO, 10%, etc.)
- passivity of the trade (whether prior stock returns are down or or up)
- cluster buying (whether multiple insiders are buying around the same time)
    - only a positive indicator: its presence is good; its absence has no meaning
- insider's track record with buying
- days between filing and trading
- insider track record
    --> average trade result @ 30, 60, 90 days
    --> number of wins
    --> number of losses
- company track record

IDEAS FOR OUTPUTS:

Simple:
    - will be winning (perhaps defined as +3%?)
    - will be losing
  * will simply light up a node as a prediction of likely profit or loss

Profit: (best idea so far)
    - multiple nodes for different ranges of profit and loss
        --> >10% loss, 5-10% loss, 0-5% loss, 0-5% win, 5-10% win, >10% win
            ? pick these bounds by looking a graph of the profits in the training data

(I actually don't think any fancy kind of neural network will be needed for form classification...)
#### LSTM NN ####
Use a long short term memory neural network structure to predict profit of a transaction?
    ! the whole point of this network is looking at past trends and having memory (hence the name)
      so it wouldn't be good for form classification

LSTM could be great for looking at pasivity of the stocks previous returns and being added to the main NN

****
Perhaps a network that is like both a feed-forward and LSTM, where it takes 3 months of previous data and then 
looks at the form and makes its profit prediction
