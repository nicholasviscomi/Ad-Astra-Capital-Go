BIG PROBLEM:
*******
[x] when I run the backtests on individual years, I get a different result than when
    I run all of the years and look at the individual result. 
        --> This shouldn't happen because the function is looping through the years already.
            It gets a clean start no matter how many other years are being analyzed. WHY
ANSWER: the trades object was continually growing. It was outside of the year in year_ranges loop so it never got reset :(
*******

Things to test:
    [x] analyze results if only going long/short
    [x] Loop through different CE_MULTIPLIERs and ATR lengths
        --> To do this I need to make ATR variable length, which also
            means keeping track of the previous 30 points
    [ ] Look at the time of day when the losing trades are
        --> Lack of volatility is terrible for profit, so don't trade at 2am or something like that bro
    [ ] Loop through different combinations of ema lengths
    [ ] Loop through different stop loss thresholds

CE Strat Problems:
    [ ] When I open a trade with CE strat, if the next candle is in the wrong direction by about 40% of
        the previous candle it's usually a big loss
    $$$ It is only successful going either long or short. CANNOT do both
    ??? Almost double the amount of losing trades compared to winning ones
    [ ] Don't trade when theres no volume

[ ] Should I just append the csv file with a ton of indicators I calculate?
    ??? Could then sell this data on reddit for cheap or something
