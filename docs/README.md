# Analysis of SEC Filings and Various Backtesting

This repo is a conglomerate of my deep interest in financial markets and using computation to derive patterns and insights. I backtested strategies on Bitcoin and wrote a bot that I deployed on AWS to test out my strategies on paper money (different repo). I analyzed thousands of SEC form 4 filings in conjunction with price data to see if predictable wins could be found by following **legal** insider trading. I used deep learning techniques to try and forecast price data based on activity within a company. Overall, lots of data processing, analysis, and visualization
